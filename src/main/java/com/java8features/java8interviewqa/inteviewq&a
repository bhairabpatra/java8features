1. What is the new feature of  java8
    - Functional interface
    - Stream API
    - Local date & time
    - String Joiner
    - Method reference
    - Special iterator
    - Optional
    - Static & default method
    - Lambda expression

2. What is the advantage of java8
    - More readable anc consise code
    - parallel streaming
    - Functional programming

 3 What is meta space
    - Earlier JVm used to store heap space to store the object now meta space store the class in java8
    - PermGen is fixed but metaspace can resize dynamically

 4 What is SAM in java8
    - SAM stands for single abstract method
    - SAM interface is called Functional interface
    - The interface which contains only one abstract method is called FI
    - To represent FI we use @FunctionalInterface

  5. Can FI extend and inherit another interface
     A Functional interface can extends anther interface if it doesn't contains abstract method . bcz it violates functional interface rule.

  6. What is Default interface

     The method which contains body and and used default keyword

  7. What is static method
       - The method contains body with static keyword is called static method
       - Static method is introduced in java 1.8
       - Static method cant override

  8. What are pre defined FI
        - Runnable
        - callable
        - comparator
        - comparable
        - consumer
        - predict
        - supplier

  9. what is lambda expression

        - Lambda expression with out name , modifier & return type
        - Lambda expressions are used to write functional programming
        - FI are used to invoke lambda expressions

   10. What is lambda expression give an example
        - (x) -> System.out.println(x)

   11. What is method reference
        - It is alternate for lambda expression
        - (x) -> System.out.println(x)
        - (x) -> System.out::println

   12. What is optional class in java 8
        - it usd to check  the null pointer expression
        - Optional class is container it is the part of util class
        - it contains isPresent() method to check is null is present
        - to get value from optional objet use get()

   13.  What is stream API
        - Its introduced java 1.8
        - it is represent sequence of object
        - Stream is used for only process the data its not datastructures

   14.  What is the main component of the stream
        - source(it can be collection / array)
        - MAp(function)
        - filter (predicate)
        - sorted(Comparator)

   15.  What is intermediate & terminal operation in stream 17:00
        - intermediate operations always return new stream
            > ex Filter & Map
        - Terminal operations will return result
            > Count()

   16. What is difference and collection and stream
        - Collection are used to store the data its a datastructures
        - Stream is used to process the data

   17. What is data & time Java8
       - Java8 introduced new class
            LocalDate()
            LocalTime()
            LocalDateTime()
